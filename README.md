# Useful tutorial for daily bioinformatics work

This repository lists extremely handful online tutorial needed for daily bioinformatics work. The content separates in five major sections including **Linux**, **R**, **Python** , **Framework** and **Theory**.

## Linux
[**Bioinformatics Data Skills**](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files): Really useful introduction to basic bioinformatics skill for beginners. Its PDF document settles in **Linux** folder.

[**GNU Parallel**](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/): a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. Its PDF document settles in **Linux** folder.

[**GNU Screen**](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/): a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. A shortcut cheat sheet can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/fredrick/1216878).

## R
[**R for data science**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/): If you use R to do data analysis, it is the first book you have to read. Maybe you prefer Chinese tutorial, another great book can be found [here](https://github.com/zhjx19/introR/blob/master/pdf/%E5%BC%A0%E6%95%AC%E4%BF%A1-1393%E9%A1%B5-R%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%9A%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8Etidyverse-%E5%AE%8C%E6%95%B4%E8%AF%BE%E4%BB%B6(%E5%B8%A6%E4%B9%A6%E7%AD%BE).pdf). As you feel confident about your R skills, you can try solving issues listed [here](https://github.com/zhjx19/tidyverse120/blob/main/%E7%8E%A9%E8%BD%AC%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%A4%84%E7%90%86120%E9%A2%98.pdf). 

[**ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis**](https://ggplot2-book.org/): introduction to underlying graphic grammer behind **ggplot2**.

## Python
[**Basic use of Python**](https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-Core-50-Courses): may be the best Chinese Python tutorial for beginners.

[**Machine learning based on sklearn**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1P7411P78r/?vd_source=cd3f09bebcacfecf396259a271817a0c)ï¼šhow to use Python sklearn package to make machine learning happen. Its PDF documents settle in **Machine_learning** folder.

[**Pytorch-based deep learning**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Y7411d7Ys/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_custom_collection.content.click&vd_source=cd3f09bebcacfecf396259a271817a0c)

## Framework
[**WDL**](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl): The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and writeable syntax. Its user guide can be found [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360037117492-Overview-Getting-started-with-WDL). WDL relies on excuting engine called `cromwell`, whose java ball can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/tag/86) 

## Theory
[**Harvard Stat 115**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yS4y1Z721/): gives the beginners an overview of the proceedings in bioinformatics and computational biology and explains classic algorithm well.


## Other resource
[**Great suggestion for data visualization**](https://github.com/cxli233/FriendsDontLetFriends/tree/main#13-friends-dont-let-friends-forget-to-reorder-stacked-bar-plot ): tips not to make bad choice when visualization. 

[**Single cell tutorial**](https://github.com/hbctraining/scRNA-seq_online/blob/master/schedule/links-to-lessons.md): Great single-cell RNA-seq data analysis workshop.


[**Bulk RNAseq tutorial**](https://uofabioinformaticshub.github.io/Spring_Into_Bioinformatics/): Great Bulk RNA-seq data analysis workshop.
