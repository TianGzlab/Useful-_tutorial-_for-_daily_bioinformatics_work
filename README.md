# Useful tutorial for daily bioinformatics work

This repository lists extremely handful online tutorial needed for daily bioinformatics work. The content separates in four major sections including **Linux**, **R**, **Python** and **Theory**.

## Linux
[**Bioinformatics Data Skills**](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files): Really useful introduction to basic bioinformatics skill for beginners. Its PDF document settles in **Linux** folder.

[**GNU Parallel**](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/): a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. Its PDF document settles in **Linux** folder.

[**GNU Screen**](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/): a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. A shortcut cheat sheet can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/fredrick/1216878).

## R
[**R for data science**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/): If you use R to do data analysis, it is the first book you have to read. Maybe you prefer Chinese tutorial, another great book can be found [here](https://github.com/zhjx19/introR/blob/master/pdf/%E5%BC%A0%E6%95%AC%E4%BF%A1-1393%E9%A1%B5-R%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%9A%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8Etidyverse-%E5%AE%8C%E6%95%B4%E8%AF%BE%E4%BB%B6(%E5%B8%A6%E4%B9%A6%E7%AD%BE).pdf).
